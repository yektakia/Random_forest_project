# Random_forest_project
 This project typically involves using the Random Forest algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method primarily used for classification and regression tasks.
Random Forest Project
• Importing Dataset: Using a data manipulation library in Python (like pandas), read a CSV file. Note that while data in CSV files is typically separated by commas, in the provided file, the data is separated by semicolons (“;”). Therefore, it is essential to handle this correctly to display the data in separate columns.
• Preprocessing:
•	EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): The aim of this section is to familiarize yourself with the dataset. Perform any analyses you think will help you understand the dataset better, such as:
o	Correlation Analysis: Create a correlation matrix using a heatmap to visualize the correlations between the columns.
o	Use a boxplot to identify outliers in each column.
•	Data Cleaning: In this section, prepare the dataset for modeling based on the following points:
o	The dataset contains missing values:
	Identify these missing values.
	Impute them using conventional methods while considering the type of each feature. Note: No data should be removed; all missing values must be replaced with suitable values.
o	The age of individuals is currently updated to the day; convert this column to reflect age in years.
•	Data Normalization: Normalize each feature using the built-in methods provided by the sklearn library.
•	Splitting the Data: Divide the dataset into two parts: training and testing.
• Fitting: Use the built-in methods from sklearn to fit a Random Forest model on the training data. Pay attention to the parameters, setting the splitting criterion for the trees to Gini index, and try to find the optimal values for the number of trees and the maximum depth of the trees.
• Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy using the built-in functions from sklearn.
